# **Image to Text Generator Using Vision Transformers and GPT-2**

## Overview
This project implements an **Image to Text Generator** leveraging **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for image feature extraction and **GPT-2** for generating descriptive captions. The model processes images and outputs meaningful, contextually relevant captions, showcasing the power of combining computer vision and natural language processing.

## Features
- Uses **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for robust image feature extraction.
- Generates descriptive and coherent captions using **GPT-2**.
- Supports batch processing for handling multiple images efficiently.
- Modular and scalable architecture for further extensions and customization.

## Use Cases
- **Accessibility**: Helps visually impaired individuals understand visual content through text descriptions.
- **E-commerce**: Automates product descriptions for online stores.
- **Content Creation**: Assists in generating captions for social media platforms.
- **Media Automation**: Enables automatic tagging and metadata generation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for development.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained models for Vision Transformers and GPT-2.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for training and inference.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and handling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.

## Setup and Installation
